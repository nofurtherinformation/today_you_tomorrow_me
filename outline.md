# Here today, Gone Tomorrow

Louisiana's Gulf coast is a site of incredible biodiversity, natural beauty, and economic activity--all of which relies on a stable ecosystem. This ecosystem has recovered from numerous disruptions, ranging from the rebound in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to the revitalization of several near-extinct species.

But facing the coast is a challenge from which recovery may not be possible -- sea level rise. Fueled by climate change, the ever-increasing waterline threatens the fragile biodiversity unique to the Mississippi River Delta. Louisiana's coastal region is a sensitive and critical habtiat for a variety of species:

And all these homes are threatened by the same thing, sea level rise.

This page illustrates how and when changing sea levels will impact animal habitat and the people living along the Louisiana coast. Each block on the left represents a local animal's habitat and will fade as that habitat is displaced. Hover over it to see more information.

# Onward and Upward - One Foot Higher

[1ft rise]
In the best case scenario, a one-foot sea level rise won't happen until 2030, but in the worst case scenario, we're there next year. In the intermediate case, we'll get there around 2025.

With only a one foot sea level increase, a dramatic chunk of Louisiana's low-lying coastal habitat is immediately lost. Nearly 70% of local bird habitats, 89% of fish habitats, and 96% of invertebrate habitats may be gone. Louisiana is also home to a small number of reptiles and mammals; the pockets of land these species occupy will be wiped out. Many animals may be able to move inland in response. However, species with breeding grounds in these areas and those that require specific salinities are particularly at risk. 


# Two-feet rise
[2ft rise]

The piping plover, a shorebird making its home here on the Gulf coast, is one of these vulnerable species. Recent counts of the bird across the entire U.S. place its population around 6,500. These plovers keep the beaches clean of bugs and small crustacians, allowing for our own enjoyment of the waterfront landscape.

[Plover zoom in]

At three feet, we see another jump in the inundation of the state's coastline--one that decimates the plover's habitat. The number of remaining plovers has recovered since the 1990s to their current population, but that recovery would come under severe threat if the sea were to progress this far inland.

[4ft rise]

Here along the Mississippi River banks, as the Gulf swallows more of the coast, the plover, alongside other species, are forced inland to find new homes and new sources of food.

[5ft rise]

At five feet, 77% of current bird habitats may be lost. The figures are even higher for fish and invertebrates, at 93% and 98% respectively.

It's not just the Piping Plover.

Over a hundred species have now been displaced, and current animal migration models are not confident on where they can and will move.

The damage to other animal species substantially affects human livelihoods, too. Considering the state's  historic shrimping industry, which contributes $1.3 billion a year to the state's GDP. The livelihoods of shrimp farmers were already devasted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, and has faced a challenging recovery.

Critical habitats of five major shrimp species in the area will be displaced by sea level rise, meaning that the juvenile shrimps seeking algae to feed on will need to move to new marshes and sounds. These shrimp need brackish coastal areas to fully grow, and their disappearance threatens Lousiana's sprawling shrimp industry.

[8 foot]

Not only is the coastal economy vunerable to sea level rise, so are the people themselves. If the water level rises eight feet, which is projected to occur at the end of this century in the absence of serious mitigation measures, nearly a million Louisianans will be displaced. And while the people can migrate inland, their physical homes, which are often the largest investments made by an American family, cannot. Over 300,000 housing units worth $48 billion will be wiped out, with more potentially to follow.

Here, we have some cold comfort--only the most extreme models extend sea level rise beyond eight feet. 

[10 foot]

Here today, gone tomorrow. 

We don't know where these animals and people will have to go once their homes have been wiped away. But we do know this is happening, and there are ways to slow down the climate change that induces such sea level rise. 

[call to action]
Climate change can be slowed if we as citizens of the planet begin to make simple changes to our lifestyles. Here are some suggestions for getting started:

Reduce your gasoline consumption by using fuel-efficient cars, public transportation, carpooling, walking, or biking.
Cut your electricity use by choosing more energy efficient appliances, especially on large items like refrigerators.
Eat less red meat.
Be informed and open to talking with others about the impact climate change has on the world.
