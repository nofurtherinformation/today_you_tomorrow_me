# Here today, Gone Tomorrow

Louisana's gulf coast is a site of incredible bio-diversity, natural beauty, and economic activity that relies on a stable ecosystem. The coast has been a site of recovery -- from the wake of Hurricane Katrina to numerous nearly-extinct species, some recoveries have been more complete than others.

But facing the coast is a challenge from which recovery may not be possible -- sea level rise. Fueled by climate change, ever-increasing high water marks threaten the precarious biodiversity unique to the Mississippi River Delta. Louisiana's coastal region is a sensitive and critical habtiat for a variety of species, home to:

And all these homes are threatened by the same thing, sea level rise.

This page illustrates how and when this sea level rise will impact animal habitat as well as people living along the coast. Each block on the left represents an animal's habitat and will fade as that animal's habitat is displaced -- hover over it to see more information.

# Onward and Upward - One Foot Higher

[1ft rise]

In the best case scenario, a one foot sea level rise won't happen until 2030, but in the worst case scenario, we're there next year. Somewhere in the middle puts around 2025.

At one foot higher, a dramatic chunk of habitat is immediately lost. Many animals may be able to shift habitats, moving inland in response. Breeding grounds, species requiring specific salinities are particularly at risk. 

[2ft rise]

The Piping Plover, a shorebird making its home here on the gulf coast, is one of these species. Recent counts of the species across the entire US place its numbers around 6,500. These Plovers keep the beaches clean of bugs and small crustacians, allowing for our own enjoyment of the waterfront landscape.

At three feet sea level we start to see a dramatic impact on the habitats. These areas represent the Plover's habitat [Flash]. The number of remaining Plovers has recovered since the 1990s to their current population, but that recovery may be reversed.

Here along the Mississippi River banks, as the gulf sea level rises, the plover -- alongside other species -- are forced inland to find new homes and new sources of food.

It's not just the Piping Plover.

Over a hundred species have now been displaced, and current models are not confident on where they will end up.

The impacts on species have substantial effects on human activity, too. Even today, some shrimping locations have only recently recovered from pollution stemming from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
Critical habitats of 5 shrimp species for the area will be displaced, meaning that the juvenile shrimps seeking algae to feed on will need to move to new marshes and sounds. These shrimp need brackish coastal areas to fully grow, and without them Lousiana's 1.3 billion dollar shrimp industry is threatened.

[8 foot]

As we approach the edges of the current model, the human impact comes into clear focus. At 8 feet of sea level rise, projected to occur at the end of this century unless serious action is taken, XXX living there today people would be displaced in Louisana alone. Of those, XXX may sit below the povery line and hold less than an high school degree, putting them in particular danger for finding a new home. $XXX,XXX worth of today's housing real estate will be wiped out, and more potentially to follow.

A cold comfort, but only the most extreme models extend sea level rise beyond eight feet. 

[9 foot]

[10 foot]

Here today, gone tomorrow. 

We don't know where these animals and people will have to go. But we do know this is happening, and there are ways to slow down sea level rise.
